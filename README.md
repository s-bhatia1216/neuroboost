A Proof of Concept to Implement CNNs and RNNs to analyze and predict trends in cognitive function

NeuroBoost is an innovative smartwatch and software designed to improve daily cognitive function by integrating advanced physiological sensors and machine learning algorithms. The device monitors key indicators such as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (ECG/PPG), and movement (accelerometer) to project EEG-like data and provide actionable insights on cognitive and emotional states. This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) used to analyze the sensor data and enhance user experience.
